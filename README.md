# queen-clojure

There are two types of generating sequence functions:

1. get the sequence under specified number
2. get the sequence from 0 or 1 to specified index

Most of the case, type 1 is generated with filtering the integer collection using bollean function, while type 2 is generated by applying the function to a nonnegative continuing list.

For exapmle, prime? is used in type 1, and factorial is used in type 2.
